This extension integrates Plesk with Google DNS, so you can:
- Synchronize all DNS zones records between Plesk and Google DNS name servers at once
- Push DNS updates automatically to Google DNS

### Notice
You must create the domain in [Google Console Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/dns/zones/) to be able to synchronize it.

I hope to improve this extension and be able to also automatically create the zones, you can help to improve this extension throught the [github repository](https://github.com/spacedogcs/plesk-googledns)
